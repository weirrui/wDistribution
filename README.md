# Weighted sample distribution
This code is the method of calculating the weighted empirical distribution.

## Overview
For the weighted empirical distribution, first calculate the mean and variance of the weighted samples, then sum the corresponding weights and calculate the relative frequency density, and finally get the probability density function. This method is simple and easy to understand and use.

## Data Import and Analysis
The function of matlab is function [output variable] = function name （input variable）

In this case, function [ctX,N] = f_wdistribution(X,W,edges).
The input variable is X(data), W(weight) and edges; the output variable is ctX and N.

## Installation
To install any release version of MATLAB

## Instructions
1.Add to your path 

2.Read in the data you need to process

3.From the directory, run f_wdistribution.m
